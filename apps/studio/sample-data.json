      "summary": "Transformed a legacy CRM into a modern, scalable platform for a leading forex broker.",
      "problem": "The existing CRM was built on outdated technology, suffering from poor performance, frequent downtime, and an inability to scale with growing user demands. The monolithic architecture made updates risky and time-consuming, while redundant code and database queries slowed everything down.",
      "solution": "Led a complete re-architecture of the system, breaking it into modular services. Implemented efficient database indexing, optimized queries, and introduced caching layers. Developed a seamless migration script to transfer over 300,000 individual assets from the old system to the new one, ensuring data integrity throughout the process.",

        "50% improvement in system responsiveness",
        "Eliminated redundant code and database queries",

      "problem": "The platform was integrating with multiple payment gateways, each with different APIs and response formats. Deposits were occasionally missed during gateway downtime or network issues, leading to customer complaints and manual reconciliation work.",
      "solution": "Designed and implemented a unified payment gateway wrapper as a self-hosted microservice. Introduced a queue-based system to ensure no deposits were missed during downtime. All transactions were logged and tracked, with automatic retry mechanisms and real-time status updates to the CRM.",
